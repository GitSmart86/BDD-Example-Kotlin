Thanks for the interesting refactor scene.

I had 0 kotlin and very low java knowledge coming in, so it was nice to get a feeling for their structure. I used my own notes and knowledge of BDD (Dave-Farley) and GoF preferences, and used Claude Code to digest and implement. I revoked some of his directions and wanted a more purist BDD approach.

It isn't completely polished, but its mostly there.

Thanks again and cheers.
